# Web Development Semester Project

## General Idea:
Currently I am thinking about doing some sort of study / language learning app. I don't know if you know Anki at all (spaced repetition study app), but I would want to do some sort of web-based version of that combined with a couple of the prebuilt lesson components like duolingo.

I have no idea what to call it so for now I'll call it "Junker"
