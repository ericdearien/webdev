# Web Development Semester Project

## General Idea:
Currently I am thinking about doing some sort of study / language learning app. I don't know if you know Anki at all (spaced repetition study app), but I would want to do some sort of web-based version of that combined with a couple of the prebuilt lesson components like duolingo.

I have no idea what to call it so for now I'll call it "Junker"

# ASSIGNMENT 3
The login and registration pages can be found either in src/server/public/pages or can be viewed by running the application and going to localhost:10000 and clicking on the login button. If you want to see some of the custom html elements that I used, see src/server/public/components. Styles are in src/server/public/styles.
