        <p>I have no idea what to put here yet, so here is the contents of the README file:</p>
        <br>
        <p>so far just the login and register pages exist, you can find them in the navigation bar up top ^^</p>

        <p>Currently I am thinking about doing some sort of study / language learning app. I don't know if you know Anki at all (spaced repetition study app), but I would want to do some sort of web-based version of that combined with a couple of the prebuilt lesson components like duolingo.
    
            I have no idea what to call it so for now I'll call it "Junker"</p>
